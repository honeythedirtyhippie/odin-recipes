    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An undeniable classic! Comfort food at it's finest. Serve with country gravy and mashed potatoes,
         with some cooked greens on the side for the untimate comfort dinner. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless pork chops</li>
        <li>1 cup flour</li>
        <li>1-1/2 tbsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp fresh ground pepper 1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1-1/2 tsp cayenne</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
         <li>1 tbsp hot sauce canola oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Mix flour, paprika, pepper, salt, and cayenne together in a shallow plate.</li>
    <li>Beat eggs and hot sauce together in a small bowl, transfer to a shallow plate.</li>
    <li>Lightly cover a pork chop in plastic wrap and bash it with the flat side of a meat hammer 
        (from the middle outward) until it is half the thickness it was when you began.</li>
    <li>Repeat with other pork chops.</li>
    <li>Add enough oil in a heavy high sided pan (like a Dutch oven) to reach half way up the pork chop.
    <li>Dredge each pork chop in flour, egg, then flour again and place on a rack. Allow to dry for 
        about 5 minutes while your oil is heating.</li>
    <li>Pre-heat oil until it reaches 360 F.</li>
    <li>Carefully slip one pork chop into the oil and set a timer for 5 minutes. Ideally, you want
         the temperature to stay between 360-375 F so keep a close eye on it.</li>
    <li>When the timer beeps, carefully flip the pork chop over and fry for another 5 minutes. 
        Remove and place on a paper towel covered plate.</li>
    <li>Repeat with the rest of the pork chops, adjusting the temperature as needed.</li>
    <li>Enjoy with more hot sauce.</li>
    </ol>
